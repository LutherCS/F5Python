# Write a function to multiply two matrices and return the product in the end
'''def task1(matrix, other_matrix)'''

# Given a string which contains alphanumeric characters only, sort and print the string in the following manner:
# 1. All sorted lowercase letters are ahead of uppercase letters
# 2. All sorted uppercase letters are ahead of digits
# 3. All sorted even digits are ahead of sorted odd digits.
'''def task2(string)'''

# Return True if the n is prime and is also prime in some other base; otherwise, return False
'''def task3(n, base)'''

# We may call a list reduced if all of its elements are equal
# Given a list, find the fewest number of elements to delete to get the reduced list
# e.g., [3,5,7,8,8,8] is a not a reduced list, but [8,8,8] is
# The minimum number is 3 since we had to delete 3,5 and 7 to fully reduce the list
'''def task4(lst)'''

# Write a program to check whether the equation x^2*k + 1 = 2x has real solutions or not
# Return True if it does; otherwise, return False
# Note: x^2 is x to the power of two a.k.a x-squared
'''def task5(k)'''

# Write a program to read the email address out of string
# e.g., "Hello, my name is Scarlet, my email address is scarlet@email.com should return scarlet@email.com
# You can assume that there are only spaces before and after the email
'''def task6(string)'''
